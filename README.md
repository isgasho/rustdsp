# rustdsp

This is a toy for playing with some dsp in rust. It's built entirely on exploring the `sample` crate while pairing and discussing the ergonomics of dsp in general.

It does nothing useful except serve as a reminder of the things we talked about in the pairing session. It doesn't build. Don't expect much if you're looking at this code.
